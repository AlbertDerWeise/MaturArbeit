randtext = "In the vast expanse of the cosmic ocean, we are but fleeting specks of stardust, dancing to the rhythm of the universe's symphony. Through the ebbs and flows of time, we seek meaning in the chaos, weaving tales of love, loss, and triumph against the canvas of infinity. Let your imagination soar beyond the confines of reality, where dreams collide with destiny and the whispers of the cosmos guide us to unknown shores. Embrace the uncertainty, for in the depths of uncertainty lies the beauty of exploration. As we traverse the celestial tapestry, let us remember that we are but passengers on this cosmic voyage, bound together by the threads of existence, boundless and eternal."

Literature classes should (not) be abolished. "Literature classes are pure waste of time and should be abolished." This has been my attitude towards reading and interpreting books in recent years. An unfortunate stance for a high school student who must spend 4-5 hours a week dealing with books and texts in German, English, and French. Conversations with others often meet with incomprehension. Phrases like: "It is important for general cultural education," "It enhances your language skills and teaches you to argue," or "These are classics that one must have read" are heard repeatedly. Does literature really bring the widely praised cultural enrichment to my life and that of others? Is literature truly so important for life in today's society, or is it ultimately just a nerve-wracking waste of time? German lessons undergo a clear shift during school years: away from grammar, sentence structure, and syntax towards literary history and the interpretation of texts and books. A development that makes sense, given the advanced linguistic competence of students in higher grades. At a certain point, every student has a command of the German language to the extent that they can express themselves both in writing and orally in a grammatically correct and refined way. The ability to communicate one's thoughts, opinions, and concerns is an important skill that society also demands, without which working life becomes very difficult. Writing texts in emails, letters, or chat messages correctly is a societal minimum requirement, and one immediately attracts negative attention if one fails to do so. It is undisputed that everyone should learn this skill. However, literature classes go beyond this, and at this point, some people start to question whether the 4 weekly lessons of German are still meaningful or even justified: "This time could be better used, for example, in history or the natural sciences." There are also voices in society saying that too much talking and too little action is happening, whether in (climate) politics or in one’s own company. "Actions instead of words" is Coop’s slogan promoting a move toward climate-friendliness. From this perspective, literature is also a complete waste of time. But can we really reduce literature to this? A pointless engagement with irrelevant texts for the sake of personal development and broadening horizons? The answer is clear: No. Does that mean that literature brings added value to our lives? Not necessarily. That reading books doesn't push society forward can, I believe, be accepted as a given fact. Sure, books one has read always influence our thinking in some way, but a complete change of mindset is rarely triggered by a book. (And if this ever does happen, it probably wasn't a book from literature class.) Even the Swiss writer Peter Bichsel shares this view, as seen in his interview in "Das Magazin" from January 20, 2018. He sees literature as a means of creating solidarity among people. An interesting thought, I find. My first reaction to that: "True, many of us are in the same community of suffering, forced to read the same books." Discussions about school literature often involve debating which book was the worst, most disgusting, or most boring. However, it's a completely different conversation when talking about a book one read for pleasure and finding out that a colleague is also enthusiastic about it. Extensive praise for this or that chapter, discussions about which character is the most likable, or admiration for the author’s attention to detail soon follow. Yes, reading creates solidarity, builds friendships, and provides a basis for conversation, whether in one way or another. But just as solidarity can come from discussing the last football game of a favorite team or a shared hobby, literature isn’t the only way to create human connections. It’s important to recognize that excluding people can also happen when they haven’t read a certain book, just as it does when someone doesn’t care for football. People develop solidarity in many ways, and literature is one of them, though it certainly helps foster language development and expands vocabulary—this is undeniable. Especially in childhood, regular reading can positively influence language sensitivity and comprehension. However, the question arises again: Is literature class the right way to do this? Since it starts relatively late and linguistic competence is usually not the main focus. Finally, I would like to address how literature fosters cultural understanding and critical thinking, and I will try to outline an alternative solution for acquiring these skills. The purpose of high school is to prepare students for higher education and societal maturity, which includes gaining an understanding of past events, the background of conflicts, and other cultures. What could be more suitable than history classes to foster exactly that? Sources and the reading of historical texts are essential in history lessons and convey precisely these contents: critical thinking and cultural understanding. Reading seemingly randomly selected books in German class to impart the same things seems rather unnecessary and unattractive. In conclusion, I want to clarify that I am not suggesting that reading has no benefits—that would be wrong. However, the widespread belief that these benefits can only be achieved through literature classes does not reflect reality in my view. Other school subjects, books read out of personal interest, or exchanges with friends and family are equally capable of shaping us as individuals, just as literature does. The difference is that one does something enjoyable and, in the process, has time to address important societal issues like climate politics. After all, sitting on the couch or in school all day reading will not move humanity forward. *To improve the flow of reading, gender-neutral language has been omitted, and the female form has been used throughout. Naturally, all genders are meant.
